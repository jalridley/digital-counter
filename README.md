## Pinball Wizard Score Generator
### Fake it til ya make it!

Got a vintage pinball machine backglass wall mounted or in a lightbox?
     
Fill those empty score windows and be a winner!
    
Generate random scores, print and stick 'em on your pinball machine
backglass.
     
Sized specifically for machines made by Bally between 1977 and 1988,
model depending.
      
Pinball Wizard is a niche little app which allows the user to randomly fake their pinball machine scores at the click of a button. Built because I needed it. I made a lightbox for my vintage 1979 Dolly Parton pinball machine backglass and the windows where the digital scores were displayed needed numbers. I thought, why hack my way through Photoshop when I can build an app! Vanilla Javascript with some fun CSS to get that sweet 70s digital number overlay. Opens the browser print window to print the results to PDF for print to actual size.
