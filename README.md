Generate random scores, print, cut and stick 'em on your pinball machine
backglass.
     
Sized specifically for machines made by Bally,
model depending.
      
Pinball Wizard randomly fakes pinball machine scores at the click of a button. Built because I needed it. I made a lightbox for my vintage 1979 Dolly Parton pinball machine backglass and the windows where the digital scores were displayed needed numbers. I thought, why hack my way through Photoshop when I can build an app? Vanilla Javascript with some fun CSS to get that sweet 70s/80s look. Opens the browser print window to print the results to size.
