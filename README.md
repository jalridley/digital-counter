Pinball Wizard is a niche little app which allows the user to randomly fake their pinball machine scores at the click of a button. Built because I needed it. I made a lightbox for my vintage 1979 Dolly Parton pinball machine backglass and the windows where the digital scores were displayed needed numbers. I thought, why hack my way through Photoshop when I can build an app! Vanilla Javascript with some fun CSS to get that sweet 70s digital number overlay. Opens the browser print window to print the results to PDF for print to actual size.
